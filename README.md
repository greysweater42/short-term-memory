## short term memory

The goal of the project is predicting whether a patient has a short-term memory disturbance, based on EEG data.

The idea is to 

- transform the raw EEG signal by Fourier or wavelet transform 

- and then input it into a convolutional or recurrent artifical neural network.

So far, none of these methods brought a satisfactory predictive model.
